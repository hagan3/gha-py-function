    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the full interface of the `forecast()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best known and most frequent usage of `forecast` enables forecasting on test sets that immediately follows training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in many use cases it is necessary to continue using the model for some time before retraining it. This happens especially in **high frequency forecasting** when forecasts need to be made more frequently than the model can be retrained. Examples are in Internet of Things and predictive cloud resource scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show how to use the `forecast()` function when a time gap exists between training data and prediction period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminology:\n",
    "* forecast origin: the last period when the target value is known\n",
    "* forecast periods(s): the period(s) for which the value of the target is desired.\n",
    "* lookback: how many past periods (before forecast origin) the model function depends on. The larger of number of lags and length of rolling window.\n",
    "* prediction context: `lookback` periods immediately preceding the forecast origin\n",
